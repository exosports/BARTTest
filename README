This is BARTTest, the collection of tests for radiative-transfer codes. It is 
configured by default to test BART, the Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer 
code. After executing the tests on an RT code that has not yet been verified by
BARTTest, please submit the results as a pull request on Github to be added 
to the test suite.
