\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document describes BARTTest, a collection of tests for 
radiative-transfer (RT) codes. The tests include simple forward models with 
analytically-verifiable answers, realistic forward models for an 
HD 189733b-like planet with various types of temperature profiles, and 
retrievals on synthetic and real data. The simple models test the 
presence, shape, and strength of lines and other basic aspects of RT codes. 
The realistic forward models and retrievals provide results that can be 
compared with other RT codes.

BARTTest is configured by default to test BART, the Bayesian Atmospheric 
Radiative Transfer code. The configuration and input files are provided 
as reference for users to see the exact setup for each test so that it 
can be reproduced by other RT codes. This manual provides a description 
of each test as well as each individual file for further clarity.

This manual describes the BARTTest program usage for the user
(Sections \ref{sec:setup} through \ref{sec:example}) and
potential contributors (Section \ref{sec:howto}).  Section \ref{sec:setup} 
indicates the system requirements and how to obtain the code. 
It also details the commands to run the program.
Section \ref{sec:files} describes the directories and files contained in 
BARTTest.  Section \ref{sec:example} shows how to execute BARTTest from start 
to finish for BART.  Section \ref{sec:howto} details how a user would 
contribute the results of their RT code to BARTTest.

\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{System Requirements}
The requirements to run BARTTest are dependent on which tests the user wishes 
to execute. The isothermal, comparison, and retrieval tests all have greater 
requirements for storage and RAM. The generation of TLI files and the 
retrievals are by default set to use 10 CPU cores. To use less, the user must 
alter the configuration files; TLI generation can use as few as 1 core, but 
the retrievals require at least 3 cores to ensure proper sampling of the 
parameter space.

Requirements (excluding isothermal, comparison, and retrieval tests):
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item 1-core CPU
  \item 1 GB stoage
  \item 4 GB RAM
\end{itemize}

Requirements (all tests):
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item 3-core CPU
  \item 40 GB storage
  \item 16 GB RAM (due to TLI generation config default)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Methods}
\label{sec:commands}
The user has a number of ways to run the tests depending on where they are at 
in the process. The general process is as follows when running BARTTest for 
BART:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item Pull BART from Github and compile
  \item Pull line lists (note: only necessary for 
        isothermal, comparison, and retrieval tests)
  \item Run the tests
  \item Produce plots of the results
\end{itemize}

The program is controlled by a Makefile in the top-level directory; all 
commands to execute BARTTest thus take the form of 
make {\textless}command{\textgreater}, executed 
from the top-level directory. The configured commands are listed in 
Table \ref{tbl:makecommands}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\label{tbl:makecommands}

run the package in some other manner, it must be manually configured.

\section{Descriptions of Directories and Files}
\label{sec:files}

This section describes the files and subdirectories in BARTTest.

\subsection{Top-level Files}
The BARTTest directory contains 3 files: LICENSE, Makefile, and README.

\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
    \item LICENSE is identical to Section \ref{sec:license}. It contains the usage license.
    \item Makefile is the main driver of the program; it handles commands used 
to execute tests, download line lists, and so on. See Section 
\ref{sec:commands} for more information.
    \item README is a very brief version of this manual.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{code-output}
\label{sec:output}
The code-output directory contains the data files produced by executing 
each test. Each subdirectory is associated with the output from a particular 
RT code, and these are numbered according to the time that the output was 
received. For example, there is a directory ``01BART'' which contains BART's 
output for each of the tests as it was the first code to be tested.

\subsection{doc}
The doc directory contains documentation related to BARTTest. The main file 
of note is barttest-user-manual.pdf, which you are currently reading.

\subsection{lib}
The lib directory contains various functions and scripts used in the execution 
of BARTTest.

Files in the directory:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item comparison.py: Script used to plot the results of f09 for multiple codes (see Section \ref{sec:comp}).
  \item makeplots.py: Contains functions used to plot the results of f01 - f08, and produces those plots when executed.
  \item opacityconv.py: Contains a function to read a (binary) Transit opacity file, convert it to Numpy arrays, and save out a .npz file.
  \item voigtcomp.py: Contains a function to compare the line profile from the 
broadening test with the normalized theoretical Voigt profile corresponding to the setup (temperature, pressure, molecular properties, layer abundances). Used in the broadening test (see Section \ref{sec:broadening}).
  \item voigt.py: Contains functions to compute a Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profile. Used by voigtcomp.py to compute the normalized theoretical Voigt profile.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{results}
\label{sec:results}
The results directory contains the plots of the output of each test. It is 
similar in structure to code-output: each subdirectory is associated with 
the plots of the output of a particular RT code, and these are numbered 
according to the time that the output was received. 

The plots subdirectory contains plots of the output of multiple codes for 
the comparison and retrieval tests. Subdirectories within the plots 
subdirectory are named according to the codes that are being compared and 
what is being compared (`comparison-iso' or `retrieval-inv'). For example, a 
comparison of `BART', `code', and `othercode' for the isothermal comparison 
test would be located at 
BARTTest/results/plots/BART{\_}code{\_}othercode{\_}comparison-iso/

\subsection{tests}
\label{sec:tests}
The tests/ directory contains the setups for each test. The subdirectory 
00inputs/ contains the inputs used for tests. The remaining 
subdirectories are the tests; subdirectories named f{\#}{\#}name are forward 
model tests, while those named r{\#}{\#}name are retrieval tests. Each 
subdirectory is detailed below. Note that paths in this section are given 
with respect to BARTTest/tests/.

The forward model tests are configured for Transit, the radiative transfer 
package of BART. The retrieval tests are configured for BART. These 
input and configuration files are provided so that the user may reference 
these for clarity on the exact setup for each test; the following sections 
will describe each file in each subdirectory. Note that other RT or retrieval 
codes may handle inputs differently, such as in the case of collision-induced 
absorptions.

In general, each forward model test will have a Transit configuration 
file (i.e., broadening{\_}emission.trc), a Pylineread configuration file 
(i.e., broadening.plc), and an atmospheric model (i.e., broadening.atm). 
Some tests have multiple configuration files or atmospheric models, such as 
f05. For the synthetic retrieval tests, each directory 
will have two BART configuration files for ttransit and eclipse geometry 
(i.e., iso{\_}emission.brt), and four 
text files containing the eclipse and transit depths and uncertainties 
(i.e., iso{\_}ecldepths.txt and iso{\_}ecluncs.txt).

\subsubsection{00inputs}
\label{sec:inputs}
00inputs contains the input files used for Transit (the radiative transfer 
package of BART) to execute the tests.

New (fake) molecules are defined to be used in the f01 - f06 tests:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item CG1, similar to H2
  \item CG2, similar to He
  \item CG3, similar to N2
  \item LG1, similar to H2O
  \item LG2, similar to CH4
  \item LG3, similar to CO
  \item LG4, similar to CO2
\end{itemize}
Note that due to the similarity between these molecules, the user may use 
the real molecule in place of the fake one as far as calculations are 
concerned (mass, isotopes, isotope ratios, etc.). However it is important to 
note that the line lists for these fake molecules do not match the real line 
lists of the real molecules; be sure to use the supplied .par line lists.\\

\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item CIA{\_}HITRAN{\_}H2He{\_}0200-9900K{\_}0.5-500um.dat: An opacity table for collision-induced absorptions between H2 and He molecules.
  \item litran.dat: A modified version of the HITRAN definitions file used by 
        the Pylineread module (reads line lists to build a file of line 
        transitions) of Transit. Defines the fake molecules listed above.
  \item molecules.dat: A modified version of the molecule definitions file 
        used by Transit. Defines the fake molecules listed above.
\end{itemize}

        as input.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f01oneline}
\label{sec:oneline}
This test uses a model atmosphere that has one layer of 100\% LG1, and all 
remaining layers 85\% CG1 and 15\% CG2. LG1 has only one line at ~2.29 um. 
The test is executed in eclipse geometry.\\

Files in f01oneline/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item oneline.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.
  \item oneline.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates line 
        list input file for Transit.
  \item oneline{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f02fewline}
\label{sec:fewline}
This test uses a model atmosphere that has one layer of 100\% LG2, and all 
remaining layers 85\% CG1 and 15\% CG2. LG2 has three lines: ~2.15 um, 
~2.29 um, ~3.20 um. The test is executed in both eclipse and transit 
geometries.\\

  \item fewline{\_}transmission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        transmission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f03multiline}
\label{sec:multiline}
This test uses a model atmosphere that has one layer of 100\% LG2, one layer 
of 100\% LG3, one layer of 100\% LG4, and all remaining layers 85\% CG1 and 
15\% CG2. LG2 has lines as in f02fewline; LG3 has lines at ~2.38 um, ~2.50 um, 
and ~2.54 um; LG4 has lines at ~2.86 um, ~3.02 um, and ~3.78 um. The test is 
executed in both eclipse and transit geometries.\\

        emission spectrum.
  \item multiline{\_}transmission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        transmission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f04broadening}
\label{sec:broadening}
This test looks at the accuracy of the Voigt profile shape for one line. 
One layer of the model atmosphere has 0.01\% LG1 and 99.99\% CG3, and 
all remaining layers 100\% CG3. The layer with LG1 is at a pressure of 
0.33516 bars and a temperature of 1442.58 K. The normalized theoretical Voigt 
profile is computed for this situation by calculating the half width at 
half max (HWHM) of a Gaussian due to thermal broadening and the HWHM of 
a Lorentzian due to pressure broadening. These are used as parameters for 
the Faddeeva function; the real part of this function is related to the 
Voigt profile. This is compared to the normalized opacity spectrum of the 
line as computed by Transit.\\

Files in f04broadening/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item broadening.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.
  \item broadening.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates line 
        list input file for Transit.
  \item broadening{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f05abundance}
\label{sec:abundance}
This test explores the effect of varying the abundance of a molecule in an 
optically-thin situation. If the atmosphere is optically thin and the line 
is weak, then doubling the abundance should result in a line that is twice as 
intense.

This test uses a uniform atmosphere composed of x\% LG1 and 100-x\% CG1 at 
all layers. X ranges from 0\% to 0.1\% in steps of 0.01\%. All 11 cases 
are executed in eclipse geometry.\\

Files in f05abundance/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item abundance{\_}line.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates 
        line list input file for Transit.

        from 1e-4 to 1e-3 in steps of 1e-4.
  \item abundance{\_}noline{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. The 
        line is ``removed'' (made very, very weak) for this case.
  \item README: Brief readme about the test.
\end{itemize}

Subdirectories in f05abundance/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item atm/: Directory containing the atmospheric models. Naming convention 
        is, i.e. 1e-4{\_}uniform.atm, where 1e-4 corresponds to the abundance 
of LG1.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f06blending}
\label{sec:blending}
This test uses two lines in close proximity to look at the 
result of two lines blending together. There is a LG1 line at 2.28919 um 
and a LG2 line at 2.28921 um. LG1 and LG2 are only present in 1 layer of 
the atmospheric model.\\

Files in f06blending/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item blending.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.

        line list input file for Transit.
  \item blending{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f07multicia}
\label{sec:multicia}
Transit incorporates collision-induced absorptions (CIAs) via a text file 
opacity table in a certain format. Other codes may also handle CIAs in a 
similar manner. This test uses an atmosphere uniformly composed of 85\% H\sb{2} 
and 15\% He at all altitudes. The forward model is generated for three cases: 
no CIAs, H\sb{2}-He CIAs, and H\sb{2}-H\sb{2} and H\sb{2}-He CIAs.\\

  \item twoCIA{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum. H\sb{2}-H\sb{2} and H\sb{2}-He CIAs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f08isothermal}
\label{sec:isothermal}
This test checks the case of isothermal emission. For isothermal emission, 
the result should be a blackbody spectrum corresponding to the temperature 
of the atmosphere. Full line lists are used for multiple molecules 
Note that real molecules and line lists are used for this test, not the 
fake molecules and line lists used in previous tests.\\

Files in f08isothermal/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item isothermal.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.
  \item isothermal.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates 
        line list input file for Transit.
  \item isothermal{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f09comparison}
\label{sec:comp}
This test generates forward models for an HD 189733b-like planet for three 
different PT profiles (isothermal, noninverted, and inverted) in both 
eclipse and transit geometry. The atmosphere contains H, He, C, N, O, H\sb{2}, 
CO, CO\sb{2}, CH\sb{4}, H\sb{2}O, N\sb{2}, and NH\sb{3}. Line lists are 
included for H\sb{2}, CO, CO\sb{2}, CH\sb{4}, H\sb{2}O, and NH\sb{3}. CIAs 
are included for H\sb{2}-H\sb{2} and H\sb{2}-He.\\

Files in f09comparison/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item comparison.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates 
        line list input file for Transit. Note: requires line lists. See 
        Section \ref{sec:commands} for information on downloading line lists if 
        the user wishes to download them. Be aware that this will take some 
        time and will use {\sim}15 GB of storage.
  \item inv.tea: Atmospheric model used by Transit. Inverted atmosphere.
  \item inv{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum for the case of an inverted atmosphere.
  \item inv{\_}transmission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        transmission spectrum for the case of an inverted atmosphere.
  \item iso.tea: Atmospheric model used by Transit. Isothermal atmosphere.
  \item iso{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces

        emission spectrum for the case of a noninverted atmosphere.
  \item noinv{\_}transmission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        transmission spectrum for the case of a noninverted atmosphere.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{r01isothermal}
\label{sec:retrievals}
For this test, the isothermal emission and transmission spectra generated for 
f09comparison were binned according to 47 filters spanning 
1.97 -- 4.95 \microns (see BARTTest/tests/00inputs/filters/). 
Noise was added to the eclipse/transit 
depths by calculating the theoretical photon noise and pulling from a Gaussian 
centered on zero with a standard deviation equal to the photon noise. The test 
is to perform a retrieval of atmospheric parameters and abundances using this 
eclipse/transit depth data and compare the result to the known inputs.

Note that for the isothermal emission retrieval, the retrieved abundances will 
likely not match the known inputs. This is because, in principle, the 
abundances do not affect the resulting spectrum. Due to noise being added to 
an otherwise perfect blackbody, retrieval algorithms will try to 
fit the noise. The important result is that the retrieval PT profile is 
isothermal within 3$\sigma$, preferably within 1$\sigma$.\\

\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item iso{\_}ecldepths.txt: Text file containing the eclipse depths corresponding to the 47 filters.

  \item iso{\_}transmission.brt: BART configuration file to perform the 
        retrieval. Isothermal transmission case.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{r02noninverted}
For this test, the noninverted emission and transmission spectra generated for 
f09comparison were binned according to 47 filters spanning 
1.97 -- 4.95 \microns (see BARTTest/tests/00inputs/filters/). 
Noise was added to the eclipse/transit 
depths by calculating the theoretical photon noise and pulling from a Gaussian 
centered on zero with a standard deviation equal to the photon noise. The test 
is to perform a retrieval of atmospheric parameters and abundances using this 
eclipse/transit depth data and compare the result to the known inputs.\\

For this test, the inverted emission and transmission spectra generated for 
f09comparison were binned according to 47 filters spanning 
1.97 -- 4.95 \microns (see BARTTest/tests/00inputs/filters/). 
Noise was added to the eclipse/transit 
depths by calculating the theoretical photon noise and pulling from a Gaussian 
centered on zero with a standard deviation equal to the photon noise. The test 
is to perform a retrieval of atmospheric parameters and abundances using this 
eclipse/transit depth data and compare the result to the known inputs.\\

\subsubsection{r04WASP12b}
WASP-12b is a well-observed exoplanet with observations across the NIR and MIR. 
It is therefore a good testcase for retrieval algorithms as the plethora of 
data points allows for the constraining of some parameters. 

This test uses a combination of space- and ground-based photometric and 
spectroscopic observations of the 
dayside emission of WASP-12b to perform a retrieval of atmospheric parameters 
and abundances. Data from the following publications are used:

\section{How to Use This Software to Test RT Codes}
\label{sec:howto}
We would like you to contribute the results of your code to BARTTest! 

BARTTest has been designed with one main goal in mind: to provide verification 
that RT and retrieval codes work as intended. To do so, there are numerous 
tests that are offered in the package (see Section \ref{sec:tests}).

It is not absolutely necessary for all tests to be executed by some RT code. 
Rather, the comparison test (see Section \ref{sec:comp}) is the most important 
of the forward modeling tests due to the realistic setup; this best reflects 
the real cases RT codes are used for. Similarly, the WASP-12b case is the most 
important of the retrieval tests since it is based on real data. The more 
codes that yield the same (or similar) answer, the more confident we as a 
community can be that our codes are all implementing the same mathematics, 
and thus the more confident we can be in the results of our codes. If there 
are discrepancies between the results of different codes, the simpler forward 
modeling tests and synthetic retrieval tests may be able to diagnose the origin 
of those differences.

In order to contribute results, the user must run their RT code for the exact 
same cases as BARTTest. The user may provide a file 
(in BARTTest/code-output/{\textless}yourcode{\textgreater}/) to re-format 
their code output to that of BART's output so that existing plotting functions 
may be used to produce plots of the results. Rather than attempting 
to explain this format, the user is encouraged to look at the output of BART 
in BARTTest/code-output/01BART/. If the user does not wish to reformat the 
output of their code to match this particular format, then they must include a 
file (in BARTTest/code-output/{\textless}yourcode{\textgreater}/) to produce 
plots of the results of their code 
(in BARTTest/results/{\textless}yourcode{\textgreater}/). 
This is to ensure that the plots provided can be easily reproduced.

Contributing results to BARTTest will follow a particular format. The 
code-output/ and results/ directories will have subdirectories for each RT 
code following a specific naming convention of {\#}{\#}code/ (e.g., 01BART/) as 
described in Section \ref{sec:output}. The user may name the directory for 
their code output/results as they wish. The number 
preceeding the name of the code is determined by the order 
in which results are received via a pull request on Github; the user may pick 
a number but it may be changed depending on the order it is received (e.g., if 
two users submit results around the same time). If the user does not pick 
a brief name for their code, the authors will pick one as they see fit, 
whether based on the name of the code (i.e., BART) or based on the name of 
the author(s) if no name exists. \textbf{Note that we do not ask the user 
to submit their RT code itself, only the output of the code as well as other 
necessary files such as code used to convert the output to BART's format or 
code to produce plots of the output if it has not been re-formatted to 
BART's format.} Users that convert the output of their code to the same format 
as BART can use the existing plotting routines to produce plots of the 
results if they wish to save the maintainers of BARTTest some time. Note that 
if the re-formatted output is incorrect, the maintainers of BARTTest will not 
fix that and will leave the pull request open until the user fixes it.
