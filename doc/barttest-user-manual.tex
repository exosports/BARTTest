\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document describes BARTTest, a collection of tests for 
radiative-transfer (RT) codes. The tests include simple forward models with 
analytically-verifiable answers, realistic forward models for an 
HD 189733b-like planet with various types of temperature profiles, and 
retrievals on synthetic and real data. The simple models test the 
presence, shape, and strength of lines and other basic aspects of RT codes. 
The realistic forward models and retrievals provide results that can be 
compared with other RT codes.

BARTTest is configured by default to test BART, the Bayesian Atmospheric 
Radiative Transfer code. The configuration and input files are provided 
as reference for users to see the exact setup for each test so that it 
can be reproduced for other RT codes. This manual provides a description 
of each test as well as each individual file so that the user can easily 
locate any desired input file.

This manual describes the BARTTest program usage for the user
(Sections \ref{sec:setup} through \ref{sec:example}) and
potential contributors (Section
\ref{sec:howto}).  Section
\ref{sec:setup} indicates the system requirements and how to obtain the code. 
It also details the commands to run the program.
Section \ref{sec:files} describes the directories and files contained in 
BARTTest.  Section \ref{sec:example} shows how to execute BARTTest from start 
to finish.  Section \ref{sec:howto} details how a user would contribute the 
results of their RT code to BARTTest.

\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{System Requirements}
The requirements to run BARTTest are dependent on what tests the user wishes to 
execute. The isothermal, comparison, and retrieval tests all have greater 
requirements for storage and RAM.

Requirements (excluding isothermal, comparison, and retrieval tests):
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item 
\end{itemize}

Requirements (all tests):
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Methods}
\label{sec:commands}
The user has a number of ways to run the tests depending on where they are at 
in the process. The general process is as follows when running BARTTest for 
BART:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item Pull BART from Github and compile
  \item Pull line lists (note: necessary for 
        isothermal, comparison, and retrieval tests)
  \item Run the tests
  \item Produce plots of the results
\end{itemize}

The program is controlled by a Makefile in the top-level directory; all 
commands to execute BARTTest thus take the form of 
make {\textless}command{\textgreater}, executed 
from the top-level directory. The configured commands are listed in 
Table \ref{tbl:commands}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\label{tbl:commands}
\centering

run the package in some other manner, it is up to them to configure it as such.

\section{Descriptions of Directories and Files}
\label{sec:files}

This section describes the files and subdirectories in BARTTest.

\subsection{Top-level Files}
The BARTTest directory contains 3 files: LICENSE, Makefile, and README.

\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
    \item LICENSE is identical to Section \ref{sec:license}. It contains the usage 
license.
    \item Makefile is the main driver of the program; it handles commands used 
to execute tests, download line lists, and so on. See Section 
\ref{sec:commands} for more information.
    \item README is a very brief version of this manual.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{code-output}
\label{sec:output}
The code-output directory contains the data files produced by executing 
each test. Each subdirectory is associated with the output from a particular 
RT code, and these are numbered according to the time that the output was 
received. For example, there is a directory ``01BART'' which contains BART's 
output for each of the tests.

\subsection{doc}
The doc directory contains documentation related to BARTTest. The main file 
of note is barttest-user-manual.pdf, which you are currently reading.

\subsection{lib}
The lib directory contains various functions and scripts used in the execution 
of BARTTest.

Files in the directory:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
\item abuncomp.py: Contains a function used by comparison.py to compute the factor 
difference of line intensity between spectra.
\item comparison.py: Script used to compute the factor difference of line 
intensity between spectra.  Used in the abundance test (see 
Section \ref{sec:abundance}).
\item makeplots.py: Contains functions used to plot the results of various 
tests. Produces plots of results.
\item opacityconv.py: Contains a function to read a (binary) Transit opacity file 
and convert it to Numpy arrays.
\item voigtcomp.py: Contains a function to compare the line profile from the 
broadening test with the theoretical Voigt profile corresponding to the 
setup (temperature, pressure, molecular properties, layer abundances). 
Used in the broadening test (see Section \ref{sec:broadening}).
\item voigt.py: Contains functions to compute a Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt 
profile. Used by voigtcomp.py to compute the theoretical Voigt profile.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{results}
\label{sec:results}
The results directory contains the plots of the output of each test. It is 
similar in structure to code-output: each subdirectory is associated with 
the plots of the output of a particular RT code, and these are numbered 
according to the time that the output was received. 

The plots subdirectory contains plots of the output of multiple codes for 
the comparison and retrieval tests. Subdirectories within the plots 
subdirectory are named according to the codes that are being compared and 
what is being compared (`comparison-iso' or `retrieval-inv'). For example, a 
comparison of `BART', `code', and `othercode' for the comparison test would 
be located at BARTTest/results/plots/BART{\_}code{\_}othercode{\_}comparison-iso/

\subsection{tests}
\label{sec:tests}
The tests/ directory contains the setups for each test. The subdirectory 
00inputs/ contains the inputs used for tests. The remaining 
subdirectories are the tests; subdirectories named f{\#}{\#}name are forward 
model tests, while those named r{\#}{\#}name are retrieval tests. Each 
subdirectory is detailed below. Note that paths are given with respect to 
BARTTest/tests/.

The forward model tests are configured for Transit, the radiative transfer 
package of BART. The retrieval tests are configured for BART. These 
input and configuration files are provided so that the user may reference 
these for clarity on the exact setup for each test; the following sections 
will describe each file in each subdirectory. 

In general, each forward model test will have a Transit configuration 
file (i.e., broadening{\_}emission.trc), a Pylineread configuration file 
(i.e., broadening.plc), and an atmospheric model (i.e., broadening.atm). 
Some tests have multiple configuration files or atmospheric models. 
For the retrieval tests, each directory 
will have a BART configuration file (i.e., iso{\_}emission.brt), a 
Pylineread configuration file (i.e., iso{\_}emission.plc), and two 
text files containing the eclipse or transit depths and uncertainties 
(i.e., iso{\_}ecldepths.txt and iso{\_}ecluncs.txt).

\subsubsection{00inputs}
\label{sec:inputs}
00inputs contains the input files used for Transit (the radiative transfer 
package of BART) to execute the tests.

New (fake) molecules are defined to be used in the tests:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item CG1, similar to H2
  \item CG2, similar to He
  \item CG3, similar to N2
  \item LG1, similar to H2O
  \item LG2, similar to CH4
  \item LG3, similar to CO
  \item LG4, similar to CO2
\end{itemize}
Note that due to the similarity between these molecules, the user may use 
the real molecule in place of the fake one as far as calculations are 
concerned (mass, isotopes, isotope ratios, etc.). However it is important to 
note that the line lists for these fake molecules do not match the real line 
lists of the real molecules.\\

Files in 00inputs/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item CIA{\_}HITRAN{\_}H2He{\_}0200-9900K{\_}0.5-500um.dat: An opacity table for 
        collision-induced absorptions between H2 and He molecules.
  \item litran.dat: A modified version of the HITRAN definitions file used by 
        the pylineread module (reads line lists to build a file of line 
        transitions) of Transit. Defines the fake molecules listed above.
  \item molecules.dat: A modified version of the molecule definitions file 
        used by Transit. Defines the fake molecules listed above.
\end{itemize}

Subdirectories in 00inputs/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item filters/: Contains filters used for the retrieval tests.
  \item par/: Contains line lists for the fake molecules and files used to pull 
        linelists from the HITRAN website.
  \item TLI/: Contains the Transition Line Information files that Transit uses 
        as input. It is initially empty; running the tests will populate the 
        directory as they are created for each test.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f01oneline}
\label{sec:oneline}
This test uses a model atmosphere that has one layer of 100\% LG1, and all 
remaining layers 85\% CG1 and 15\% CG2. LG1 has only one line at ~2.29 um. 
The test is executed in eclipse geometry.\\

Files in f01oneline/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item oneline.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.
  \item oneline.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates line 
        list input file for Transit.
  \item oneline{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f02fewline}
\label{sec:fewline}
This test uses a model atmosphere that has one layer of 100\% LG2, and all 
remaining layers 85\% CG1 and 15\% CG2. LG2 has three lines: ~2.15 um, 
~2.29 um, ~3.20 um. The test is executed in both eclipse and transit 
geometries.\\

Files in f02fewline/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item fewline.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.

        transmission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f03multiline}
\label{sec:multiline}
This test uses a model atmosphere that has one layer of 100\% LG2, one layer 
of 100\% LG3, one layer of 100\% LG4, and all remaining layers 85\% CG1 and 
15\% CG2. LG2 has lines as in f02fewline; LG3 has lines at ~2.38 um, ~2.50 um, 
and ~2.54 um; LG4 has lines at ~2.86 um, ~3.02 um, and ~3.78 um. The test is

  \item multiline{\_}transmission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        transmission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f04broadening}
\label{sec:broadening}
This test looks at the accuracy of the Voigt profile for one line. 
One layer of the model atmosphere has 0.01\% LG1 and 99.99\% CG3, and 
all remaining layers 100\% CG3. The layer with LG1 is at a pressure of 
0.33516 bars and a temperature of 1442.58 K. The analytical Voigt profile is 
computed for this situation by calculating the half width at half max (HWHM) 
of a Gaussian due to thermal broadening and the HWHM of a Lorentzian due to 
pressure broadening. These are used as parameters for the Faddeeva function; 
the real part of this function is equal to a Voigt profile. This is compared 
to the opacity spectrum of the line as computed by Transit.\\

Files in f04broadening/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item broadening.atm: Atmospheric model used by Transit.
  \item broadening.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates line 
        list input file for Transit.
  \item broadening{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f05abundance}
\label{sec:abundance}
This test explores the effect of varying the abundance of a molecule in an 
optically-thin situation. If the atmosphere is optically thin and the line 
is weak, then double the abundance should result in a line that is twice as 
intense.

This test uses a uniform atmosphere composed of x\% LG1 and 100-x\% CG1 at 
all layers. X ranges from 0.01\% to 0.1\% in steps of 0.01\%. All 11 cases 
are executed in eclipse geometry.\\

        from 1e-4 to 1e-3 in steps of 1e-4.
  \item abundance{\_}noline{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. The 
        line is ``removed'' (made very, very weak) for this case.
  \item README: Brief readme about the test.
\end{itemize}

Subdirectories in f05abundance/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item atm/: Directory containing the atmospheric models. Naming convention 
        is, i.e. 1e-4{\_}uniform.atm
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f06blending}
\label{sec:blending}
This test uses two lines in close proximity to look at the 
result of two lines blending together. There is a LG1 line at 2.28919 um 
and a LG2 line at 2.28921 um. LG1 and LG2 only exist at one layer of the 
atmospheric model.\\

        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f07multicia}
\label{sec:multicia}
Transit incorporates collision-induced absorptions (CIAs) via a text file 
opacity table in a certain format. Other codes may also handle CIAs in a 
similar manner. This test uses a atmosphere uniformly composed of 85\% H\sb{2} 
and 15\% He at all altitudes. The forward model is generated for three cases: 
no CIAs, H\sb{2}-He CIAs, and H\sb{2}-H\sb{2} and H\sb{2}-He CIAs.\\

        emission spectrum.
  \item twoCIA{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f08isothermal}
\label{sec:isothermal}
This test checks the case of isothermal emission. For isothermal emission, 
the result should be a blackbody spectrum corresponding to the temperature 
of the atmosphere. Full line lists are used for multiple molecules (real, not 
fake as in previous tests).\\

        emission spectrum.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{f09comparison}
\label{sec:comp}
This test generates forward models for an HD 189733b-like planet for three 
different PT profiles (isothermal, noninverted, and inverted) in both 
eclipse and transit geometry. The atmosphere contains H, He, C, N, O, H\sb{2}, 
CO, CO\sb{2}, CH\sb{4}, H\sb{2}O, N\sb{2}, and NH\sb{3}. Line lists are 
included for H\sb{2}, CO, CO\sb{2}, CH\sb{4}, H\sb{2}O, and NH\sb{3}. CIAs 
are included for H\sb{2}-H\sb{2} and H\sb{2}-He.\\

Files in f09comparison/:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt
  \item comparison.plc: Configuration file for pylineread. Creates 
        line list input file for Transit. Note: requires line lists. See 
        Section \ref{sec:commands} for information on downloading line lists if 
        the user wishes to download them. Be aware that this will take a long 
        time and use a lot of hard drive space.
  \item inv.tea: Atmospheric model used by Transit. Inverted atmosphere.
  \item inv{\_}emission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        emission spectrum for the case of an inverted atmosphere.

        emission spectrum for the case of a noninverted atmosphere.
  \item noinv{\_}transmission.trc: Configuration file for Transit. Produces 
        transmission spectrum for the case of a noninverted atmosphere.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{r01isothermal}
\label{sec:retrievals}
For this test, the isothermal emission and transmission spectra generated for 
f09comparison were binned according to some filters (see 
BARTTest/tests/00inputs/filters/). Noise was added to the eclipse/transit 
depths by calculating the theoretical photon noise and pulling from a Gaussian 
centered on zero and a standard deviation equal to the photon noise. The test 
is to perform a retrieval of atmospheric parameters and abundances using this 
eclipse/transit depth data and compare the result to the known inputs.

Note that for the isothermal emission retrieval, the retrieved abundances will 
likely not match the known inputs. This is because, in principle, the 
abundances do not effect the resulting spectrum. Due to noise being added to 
an otherwise perfect blackbody, retrieval algorithms will end up trying to 
fit the noise. The important result is that the retrieval PT profile is 
isothermal within 3$\sigma$.\\

\subsubsection{r04WASP12b}
WASP-12b is a well-observed exoplanet with observations across the NIR and MIR. 
It is therefore a good testcase for retrieval algorithms as the plethora of 
data points allows for the constraining of parameters. 

This test uses a combination of space- and ground-based observations of the 
dayside emission of WASP-12b to perform a retrieval of atmospheric parameters 
and abundances. Eclipse depths/uncertainties and the filters corresponding to 
the observation are cited at the top of their respective files.\\

\section{How to Use This Software to Test RT Codes}
\label{sec:howto}
We would like you to contribute the results of your code to BARTTest! 

BARTTest has been designed with one main goal in mind: to provide verification 
that an RT code works as intended. To do so, there are numerous tests that are 
offered in the package (see Section \ref{sec:tests}).

It is not absolutely necessary for all tests to be executed by some RT code. 
Rather, the comparison test (see Section \ref{sec:comp}) is the most important 
of the forward modeling tests due to the realistic setup; this best reflects 
the real cases RT codes are used for. Similarly, the WASP-12b case is the most 
important of the retrieval tests since it is based on real data. The more 
codes that yield the same (or similar) answer, the more confident we as a 
community can be that our codes are all implementing the same mathematics, 
and thus the more confident we can be in the results of our codes. If there 
are discrepancies between the results of different codes, the simpler forward 
modeling tests and synthetic retrieval tests may be able to pin down the cause 
of the differing results.

In order to contribute results, the user must run their RT code for the exact 
same cases as those set up in BARTTest/tests/ and then format their code output 
a specific way. The specific format and naming convention is, of course, the 
format and naming convention that is adopted by BART. Rather than attempting 
to explain this format, the user is encouraged to look at the output of BART 
in BARTTest/code-output/01BART/. If the user does not wish to reformat the 
output of their code to match this particular format, then they must include a 
file (in BARTTest/code-output/{\textless}yourcode{\textgreater}/) to produce 
plots of the results of their 
code (in BARTTest/results/{\textless}yourcode{\textgreater}/). 
This is to ensure that the plots provided can be replicated.

Contributing results to BARTTest will follow a particular format. The 
code-output/ and results/ directories will have subdirectories for each RT 
code following a specific naming convention of {\#}{\#}code/ (e.g., 01BART/) as 
described in Section \ref{sec:output}. The user may name the directory for 
their code output/results as they wish. The number 
preceeding the name of the code is determined by the order 
in which results are received via a pull request on Github; the user may pick 
a number but it may be changed depending on the order it is received (e.g., if 
two users submit results around the same time). If the user does not pick 
a brief name for their code, the authors will pick one as they see fit. 

If the user converts the output of their code to the same format as BART, plots 
can be easily produced using existing files in BARTTest. 
BARTTest/lib/makeplots.py can be easily reconfigured to point to the results 
of a different RT code and produce plots of it as long as it is in the same 
format. 

As mentioned previously, to submit the results of an RT code, the user must 
submit a pull request on Github. Merging will be handled by the authors. Do 
not submit the code itself--only the output of the code and plots of 
that output!
