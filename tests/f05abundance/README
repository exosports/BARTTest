This tests uses an optically thin atmosphere to explore the relationship 
between increasing the abundance by some factor and the effect it has on the 
depth of the line produced.

The abundances are related by the following equation:
factor = (flux_norm - flux_hi) / (flux_norm - flux_lo)

where in the case of the 1e-4 spectrum
factor  = greater abundance / 1e-4
flux_lo = flux of 1e-4 spectrum in the channels where the line is present
flux_hi = flux of the greater abundance spectrum in the above channels
flux_norm = flux of those channels when no line is present


In BARTTest/lib/, there are two related files:
- abuncomp.py contains a function to compare a spectrum of a low abundance to 
  spectra of greater abundances.

- comparison.py contains a script to compare the 1e-4 spectrum to the rest of 
  the spectra in the directory.
