This compendium does not include the raw line list files.
This file will describe where to find those line list files.

The raw line lists files are NOT required in order to run the RRC.
The RRC includes intermediary files that have processed the line lists 
into BART's desired format.  The information below is solely for curious 
individuals interested in where to acquire the raw data.

At the time of finalizing the compendium, BARTTest includes a convenient 
command for users to acquire nearly all of the line lists used in the tests. 
Simply enter 
    make linelists
from the BARTTest directory.  Then will download all HITRAN, HITEMP, and ExoMol 
line lists used in the tests.  The STDS line lists will need to be acquired 
separately; see the URL listed below in the relevant section.

Below, we describe how users can acquire the line lists on their own.


HITRAN/HITEMP
-------------
To download HITRAN data, users must create a free account at https://hitran.org/
Then, the line lists for each molecule can be downloaded at 
https://hitran.org/lbl/

For HITEMP data, an account is not required.  The line lists for each molecule 
can be found at https://hitran.org/hitemp/


ExoMol
------
The line lists for each molecule can be found at 
http://www.exomol.com/data/molecules/
After downloading, they must be processed via REPACK 
(https://github.com/pcubillos/repack) to be used in BART.


STDS
----
The STDS line lists can be found at https://vamdc.icb.cnrs.fr/index.php
